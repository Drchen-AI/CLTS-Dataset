CLTS: A **C**hinese **L**ong **T**ext **S**ummarization Dataset

There are fewer Chinese datasets for automatic text summarization system and most existing datasets contain short texts, which can only be used to generate a title from short text.

CLTS is a new large-scale dataset, using the Chinese news website [ThePaper.cn](https://www.thepaper.cn). The resulting version of the dataset contains more than 180,000 **long-sequence pairs**, where each article consists of multiple paragraphs and each summary consists of multiple sentences.
